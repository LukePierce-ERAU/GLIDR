Open-source software for design single skin paragliders and kites.

<p><br>
Capabilities:
<p>
<ul>
<li>All-in-one software to design single skin wings</li>
<li>Simple editor of wing shape</li>
<li>Different triangles types, bridles and printing modes</li>
<li>Allow print small A4 papers and glue them together to get scale 1:1</li>
<li>3d model and print templates can be opened as DXF files in any CAD like Google SketchUP Pro, Autocad, Corel Draw, etc</li>
</ul>
<p><br/>
How to desing simple wing:
<p>
<ul type=square>
<li>First, define Area, AR and Number of Cells.
</li><li>Second, enter approximate Glide Ratio of your future wing. Do not type any value you want, be realistic. See wings with the same area, AR and num of cells and type close Glide Ratio. Usually kites and speedriders with low AR have Glide Ratio 4, speedflyers 5-6 and paragliders about 7-7.5 (single skin wings have 1-1.5 lower GR than double skin).
</li><li>Now go to page "Wing shape" and draw shape as you wish. Select 3d view tab and see what happens. This viewer cannot show polygonal model, so you can open file "wing_3d.dxf" (in the program folder) in any CAD like Google SketchUP Pro.
</li><li>Return back to main page and choose different options, number of lines at cascades and so on.
</li><li>When your wing is ready, go to the page Print and choose printing mode (usually separate files or overlay mode). After click Print... button, select Scale factor 1:1.
</li><li>At last, look file "bridle.txt" to line lengths and other info.
</li>
</ul>
<p>

<p><br/>
Hints:
<p>
<ul>
<li>If you see popup error messages with strange text like "Windows Scripting Host", this means you entered invalid input data few second ago. Correct values and model will be recalculated automatically.
</li><li>Hold mouse over controls, will popup expanded hint.
</li><li>If calculation takes a long time, reduce number of cells, tune your wing and then return cells back.
</li><li>Be careful! Each program launch rewrites DXF files and file "bridle.txt", so if you need them, copy to another place.
</li>
</ul>
